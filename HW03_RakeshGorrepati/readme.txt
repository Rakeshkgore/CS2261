HW:3 Instructions

Press "Start" to go to the game.
Use Up, down, left, right to move your "spaceship".
Use B to fire bullets. 
There are two ways to win the game: reach the target box or use your bullets to shoot all the "3 asteroids".
If collision with target box occurs then you win, if collision happens with asteroids or falling rectangles you lose.
**The two falling rectangles are just for obstruction so you can't shoot them down**
