MIlESTONE 3 : Update 

I have made the following updates as per your suggestion for M3:
1.Bullets are now working and will collide with "coins"  - Button B
2.Hoff is now fixed between states.
3.Ammo remaining is now implemented.
4.User row will increase if up isn't pressed, works as "gravity"
5.Win state can be reached by colliding with three coins or shooting three coins
6.Lose state can be reaches by hitting the bottom, it is no "voluntary" like last time in that i have "gravity" in place now. 
7. I have also randomly appearing bonus targets now, should be a white block for now, which can be shot since they don't move twoards the user. There are two that will appear randomly one after the other.
